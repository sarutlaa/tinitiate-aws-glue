#AWS Cloud Computing
Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers reliable, scalable, and inexpensive cloud computing services. AWS is a comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform that offers over 200 fully-featured services from data centers globally. 
It powers a wide range of infrastructure services, such as computing power, storage options, networking, and databases, offered on-demand, with pay-as-you-go pricing.

## Benefits of AWS

![AWS Benefits - Template](https://github.com/sarutlaa/tinitiate-aws-glue/assets/141533429/d6643b88-12e0-4393-91e0-67b518404c7a)

* Scalability: AWS provides scalable computing resources which means you only use what you need and can scale up or down as required.
* Cost-Effective: With AWS, you pay only for the computing power, storage, and other resources you use, with no long-term contracts or upfront commitments.
* Security: AWS utilizes an end-to-end approach to secure and harden its infrastructure, including physical, operational, and software measures.
* Flexibility and Openness: AWS supports multiple programming languages, operating systems, and databases, making it a flexible choice for software developers.
* Reliability: AWS offers a highly reliable environment where replacement instances can be rapidly and predictably commissioned.

## AWS Global Infrastructure
AWS maintains a massive global infrastructure that enhances the performance of its cloud services and offers high availability to its users.

* AWS Regions: These are specific areas around the world where AWS clusters data centers.
  Each AWS Region is a separate geographic area that allows users to choose the locality of their services to meet specific regulatory or compliance requirements.
* Availability Zones: Within each region, AWS operates multiple isolated locations known as Availability Zones.
  Each zone is made up of one or more data centers equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.
* Data Centers: AWS Data Centers are highly secure facilities that house the hardware and systems which power the various AWS services.
  They are strategically located in Availability Zones all over the world to ensure redundancy and resilience of AWS services.
* Edge Locations: These are sites deployed in major cities and highly populated areas globally.
  They are used to deliver content, reducing latency by caching data closer to end users. Edge Locations are integral to services like Amazon CloudFront and AWS Lambda@Edge.

## On-Premises vs. Cloud
* Capital Expenditure: On-premises infrastructure requires upfront capital expenditure for hardware and software, whereas AWS eliminates upfront costs, operating on a pay-as-you-go billing model.
* Maintenance and Upgrades: On-premises solutions require ongoing maintenance and periodic upgrades of hardware and software, which can be costly and time-consuming. AWS handles maintenance and upgrades, reducing the operational burden on your team.
* Scalability: Scaling on-premises infrastructure can be limited and typically requires significant planning and capital investment. In contrast, AWS provides immediate scalability and elasticity, allowing you to scale resources up or down as needed almost instantly.
* Security and Compliance: On-premises environments require significant investment in security and compliance measures. AWS provides a secure infrastructure and offers compliance certifications for a wide range of industry standards, reducing the complexity and cost of meeting regulatory requirements.
* Disaster Recovery: Implementing robust disaster recovery solutions on-premises can be expensive and complex. AWS offers cost-effective disaster recovery solutions that can be quickly implemented and scaled, providing greater flexibility and reliability.
